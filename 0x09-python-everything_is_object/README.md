### 1. Object:
- An object is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP).
- It is an instance of a class and represents a real-world entity with attributes (characteristics) and behaviors (actions).

### 2. Class vs Object or Instance:
- A class is a blueprint or template that defines the attributes and behaviors common to all objects of that type.
- An object, or instance, is a concrete occurrence of a class, with its own unique data and behavior.

### 3. Immutable vs Mutable:
- Immutable objects cannot be modified after creation (e.g., strings, tuples).
- Mutable objects can be modified after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries).

### 4. Reference:
- A reference is a value that refers to the memory location of an object.

### 5. Assignment:
- Assignment is the process of binding a value to a variable.

### 6. Alias:
- An alias is a second name for a variable, referring to the same object.

### 7. Identical Variables:
- `is` keyword checks if two variables refer to the same object.
  
### 8. Linked Variables:
- `==` checks if two variables have the same value.
  
### 9. Display Variable Identifier:
- Use the `id()` function to get the memory address.

### 10. Mutable and Immutable:
- Mutable objects can be changed after creation; immutable objects cannot.

### 11. Built-in Mutable Types:
- List, set, dictionary.

### 12. Built-in Immutable Types:
- int, float, bool, str, tuple.

### 13. Python Variable Passing:
- Python passes variables to functions by object reference.
- Changes made to mutable objects inside a function are reflected outside.
