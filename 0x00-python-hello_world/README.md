        Python Interpreter:
Usage: The Python interpreter allows you to interactively execute Python code. Simply open a terminal and type `python` to enter the interpreter. You can execute statements and see immediate results, making it a valuable tool for testing and experimentation.

        Printing Text and Variables with `print`:
Syntax: Use the `print` function to display text or the values of variables.
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  variable = 42
  print("The value of variable is:", variable)
 
        Working with Strings:
Strings in Python: Strings are sequences of characters and can be defined using single or double quotes.
  ```python
  my_string = "Python is amazing!"
  ```

         Indexing and Slicing in Python:
Indexing: Access individual elements in a sequence (e.g., a string or a list) using indices.
  ```python
  my_string = "Python"
  first_char = my_string[0]  # Access the first character
  ```

        Slicing:
 Extract subparts of a sequence using slicing.
  ```python
  my_string = "Python"
  substring = my_string[1:4]  # Extracts characters at indices 1 to 3
  ```

        Official Python Coding Style (PEP 8) and Pycodestyle:
PEP 8 Guidelines: Follow the official Python coding style guide (PEP 8) for clean and consistent code. Emphasizes readability and includes conventions for indentation, naming, and more.

Pycodestyle: Use the `pycodestyle` tool to check your code against PEP 8.
  ```bash
  pip install pycodestyle
  pycodestyle your_code.py
  ```
  Fix any reported style violations to maintain a high standard of code quality.
